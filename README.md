COBS an open-source and modular co-simulation platform for occupant-centric control of buildings with agent and occupancy simulators. We provide the ability to read the state after each simulation step in EnergyPlus and use it to determine the control action generated by the researcher's control policy. We format the platform similar to the OpenAI Gym, so researchers can port their algorithm to our platform without any problem.

COBS is open source, licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/sustainable-computing/COBS/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions in many forms, such as bug reports, pull requests, etc., and encourage the community to use, improve and extend this platform by adding their HVAC control algorithms and/or building models. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss what you would like to do.
